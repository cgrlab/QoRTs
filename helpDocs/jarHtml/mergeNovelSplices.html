<h2>Help for java command "mergeNovelSplices"</h2>

<h2>USAGE:</h2>

<pre><code>java [Java Options] -jar QoRTs.jar mergeNovelSplices [options] infileDir sizeFactorFile annotation.gtf.gz outfileDir
</code></pre>

<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>

<p>This utility takes the QC output from the standard QC utility run on a series of samples and performs two functions: first, it compiles all splice junctions across all samples and filters low-coverage novel splice junctions by mean coverage across all samples (optionally normalized with user-supplied size factors). It then assigns unique identifiers to each novel splice junction that passed this filter, and outputs a special flat gff file listing all exons, annotated splice junctions and passed-filter novel splice junctions with assigned unique identifiers for all features. Next, it uses these unique identifiers to create a new set of JunctionSeq-formatted count files, one for each input sample. This new count file will include counts for the passed-filter novel splice junctions in addition to the usual counts for annotated splice junctions, exons, and aggregated-genes, all listed by the assigned unique identifiers.</p>

<h2>REQUIRED ARGUMENTS:</h2>

<h3>infileDir:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The input file directory. (String)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>sizeFactorFile:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>(String)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>annotation.gtf.gz:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>(String)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>outfileDir:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The output file directory (String)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS:</h2>

<h3>--minCount num:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The minimum mean normalized read coverage needed for inclusion of a novel splice junction. By default, equal to 10.0. (Double)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>--stranded:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Flag to indicate that data is stranded. (flag)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>--stranded_fr_secondstrand:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nonfunctional. (flag)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>--noGzipInput:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Flag to indicate that input files are NOT be compressed into the gzip format. By default almost all input files are assumed to be compressed. (flag)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>--noGzipOutput:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Flag to indicate that output files should NOT be compressed into the gzip format. By default almost all output files are compressed to save space. (flag)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>--verbose:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Flag to indicate that debugging information and extra progress information should be sent to stderr. (flag)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>--quiet:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Flag to indicate that only errors and warnings should be sent to stderr. (flag)</p>
