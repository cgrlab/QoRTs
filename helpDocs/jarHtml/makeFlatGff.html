<h1>QoRTs: Quality Of Rna-seq Tool Set</h1>

<p>Version 0.1.6 (<a href="index.html">back to index</a>)</p>

<h2>Help for java command "makeFlatGff"</h2>

<h2>USAGE:</h2>

<pre><code>java [Java Options] -jar QoRTs.jar makeFlatGff [options] _gtffile_ _flatgfffile_
</code></pre>

<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>

<p>When running the QC command, QoRT first generates a set of non-overlapping exonic fragments out of all the exons in the genome annotation gtf file. It then assigns each exonic fragment a unique identifier. Similarly, it assigns every splice junction its own unique identifier. This command can be used to write that data to file.
It can also be used to produce a flattened gff file that adheres to the specifications used by DEXSeq.</p>

<h2>REQUIRED ARGUMENTS:</h2>

<pre><code>gtffile
    The gtf annotation file. This tool was designed to use the 
    standard gtf annotations provided by Ensembl, but other 
    annotations can be used as well. Note: if the file ends in 
    .zip or .gz the compression method will be auto-detected and 
    read accordingly.
    (String)
flatgfffile
    The output destination for the "flattened" gff annotation 
    file to be created, or '-' to write to stdout. Note: if the 
    filename ends in ".zip" or ".gz" the corresponding 
    compression method will be applied.
    (String)
</code></pre>

<h2>OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS:</h2>

<h3>--stranded:</h3>

<p>Flag to indicate that reads are stranded.</p>

<p>(flag)</p>

<h3>--DEXSeqFmt:</h3>

<p>Flag to indicate that the output gff file should be formatted for use with DEXSeq.</p>

<p>(flag)</p>

<h3>--verbose:</h3>

<p>Flag to indicate that debugging information and extra progress information should be sent to stderr.</p>

<p>(flag)</p>

<h3>--quiet:</h3>

<p>Flag to indicate that only errors and warnings should be sent to stderr.</p>

<p>(flag)</p>
