<h1>QoRTs: Quality Of Rna-seq Tool Set</h1>

<p>Version 0.1.6 (<a href="index.html">back to index</a>)</p>

<h2>Help for java command "QC"</h2>

<h2>USAGE:</h2>

<pre><code>java [Java Options] -jar QoRTs.jar QC [options] _infile_ _gtffile.gtf_ _outfiledir_
</code></pre>

<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>

<p>This utility runs a large battery of QC tools on a single given sam or bam file.This is the primary function of the QoRT utility. </p>

<h2>REQUIRED ARGUMENTS:</h2>

<pre><code>infile
    The input .bam or .sam file of aligned sequencing reads. Or 
    '-' to read from stdin.
    (String)
gtffile.gtf
    The gtf annotation file. This tool was designed to use the 
    standard gtf annotations provided by Ensembl, but other 
    annotations can be used as well.
    If the filename ends with ".gz" or ".zip", the file will be 
    parsed using the appropriate decompression method.
    (String)
outfiledir
    The output file directory.
    (String)
</code></pre>

<h2>OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS:</h2>

<h3>--minMAPQ num:</h3>

<p>Filter reads for the given minimum MAPQ. Set to 0 to turn off mapq filtering.</p>

<p>(Int)</p>

<h3>--flatgff flattenedGffFile.gff.gz:</h3>

<p>A "flattened" gtf file that matches the standard gtf file. Optional.It may also be useful for downstream analyses, as it assigns unique identifiers to all exons and splice junctions. The flattened gtf file can be generated using the "makeFlatGff" command. Note that the command must be run with the same strandedness code.
If the filename ends with ".gz" or ".zip", the file will be parsed using the appropriate decompression method.</p>

<p>(String)</p>

<h3>--singleEnded:</h3>

<p>Flag to indicate that reads are single end. WARNING: UNIMPLEMENTED and UNSUPPORTED AT THIS TIME! This utility is not designed for, and will not function properly on single-strand data!</p>

<p>(flag)</p>

<h3>--stranded:</h3>

<p>Flag to indicate that data is stranded.</p>

<p>(flag)</p>

<h3>--maxReadLength len:</h3>

<p>Sets the maximum read length. For unclipped datasets this option is OPTIONAL since the read length can be determined from the data. By default, QoRTs will attempt to determine the max read length by examining the first 1000 reads. If your data is hard-clipped prior to alignment, then it is STRONGLY recommended that this option be included, or else an error may occur. Note that using data that is hard-clipped prior to alignment is NOT recommended, because this makes it difficult (or impossible) to determine the sequencer read-cycle of each nucleotide base. This may obfuscate cycle-specific artifacts, trends, or errors, the detection of which is one of the primary purposes of QoRTs!In addition, hard clipping (whether before or after alignment) removes quality score data, and thus quality score metrics may be misleadingly optimistic. A MUCH preferable method of removing undesired sequence is to replace such sequence with N's, which preserves the quality score and the sequencer cycle information. </p>

<p>(Int)</p>

<h3>--stranded<em>fr</em>secondstrand:</h3>

<p>Flag to indicate that reads are from a fr<em>secondstrand type of stranded library (equivalent to the "stranded = yes" option in HTSeq or the "fr</em>secondStrand" library-type option in TopHat/CuffLinks). If your data is stranded, you must know the library type in order to analyze it properly. This utility uses the same definitions as cufflinks to define strandedness type. By default, the fr_firststrand library type is assumed for all stranded data (equivalent to the "stranded = reverse" option in HTSeq).</p>

<p>(flag)</p>

<h3>--testRun:</h3>

<p>Flag to indicate that only the first 100k reads should be read in. Used for testing.</p>

<p>(flag)</p>

<h3>--fileContainsNoMultiMappedReads:</h3>

<p>Flag to indicate that the input sam/bam file contains only primary alignments (ie, no multi-mapped reads). This flag is ALWAYS OPTIONAL, but when applicable this utility will run (slightly) faster when using this argument. (DEPRECIATED! The performance improvement was marginal)</p>

<p>(flag)</p>

<h3>--keepMultiMapped:</h3>

<p>Flag to indicate that the tool should NOT filter out multi-mapped reads. Note that even with this flag raised this utility will still only use the 'primary' alignment location for each read. By default any reads that are marked as multi-mapped will be ignored entirely. Most aligners use the MAPQ value to mark multi-mapped reads. Any read with MAPQ &lt; 255 is assumed to be non-uniquely mapped.  Thus: this option is equivalent to setting --minMAPQ to 0.</p>

<p>(flag)</p>

<h3>--coordSorted:</h3>

<p>Flag to indicate that input bam file is coordinate-sorted, rather than name-sorted. Note that QoRTs will take longer to run and use more memory in this mode. To improve performance, sort the data by name prior to using of QoRTs. In addition, if an (extremely) large fraction of the read-pairs are mapped to extremely distant loci (or different chromosomes), then memory issues may arise. However, this should not be a problem with most datasets. Technically this function will also allow QoRTs to work on unsorted bam files, but this is STRONGLY not recommended, as memory usage will by greatly increased.</p>

<p>(flag)</p>

<h3>--noGzipOutput:</h3>

<p>Flag to indicate that output files should NOT be compressed into the gzip format. By default almost all output files are compressed to save space.</p>

<p>(flag)</p>

<h3>--parallelFileRead:</h3>

<p>DEPRECIATED: DO NOT USE. Flag to indicate that bam file reading should be run in paralell for increased speed. Note that in this mode you CANNOT read from stdin. Also note that for this to do anything useful, the numThreads option must be set to some number greater than 1. Also note that additional threads above 9 will have no appreciable affect on speed.</p>

<p>(flag)</p>

<h3>--readGroup readGroupName:</h3>

<p>If this option is set, all analyses will be restricted to ONLY reads that are tagged with the given readGroupName (using an RG tag). This can be used if multiple read-groups have already been combined into a single bam file, but you want to summarize each read-group separately.</p>

<p>(String)</p>

<h3>--restrictToGeneList geneList.txt:</h3>

<p>If this option is set, almost all analyses will be restricted to reads that are found on genes named in the supplied gene list file. The file should contain a gene ID on each line and nothing else. The only functions that will be run on the full set of all reads will be the functions that calculate the gene mapping itself. NOTE: if you want to include ambiguous reads, include a line with the text: '<em>ambiguous'. If you want to include reads that do not map to any known feature, include a line with the text: '</em>no_feature'. WARNING: this is not intended for default use. It is intended to be used when re-running QoRTs, with the intention of examining artifacts that can be caused in various plots by a small number of genes with extremely high coverage. For example, GC content plots sometimes contain visible spikes caused by small mitochondrial genes with extremely high expression.ADDITIONAL WARNING: This feature is in BETA, and is not yet fully tested.</p>

<p>(String)</p>

<h3>--dropGeneList geneList.txt:</h3>

<p>If this option is set, almost all analyses will be restricted to reads that are NOT found on genes named in the supplied gene list file. The file should contain a gene ID on each line and nothing else. The only functions that will be run on the full set of all reads will be the functions that calculate the gene mapping itself. NOTE: if you want to EXCLUDE ambiguous reads, include a line with the text: '<em>ambiguous'. If you want to EXCLUDE reads that do not map to any known feature, include a line with the text: '</em>no_feature'. WARNING: this is not intended for default use. It is intended to be used when re-running QoRTs, with the intention of examining artifacts that can be caused by certain individual 'problem genes'. For example, GC content plots sometimes contain visible spikes caused by small transcripts / RNA's with extremely high expression levels.ADDITIONAL WARNING: This feature is in BETA, and is not yet fully tested.</p>

<p>(String)</p>

<h3>--numThreads num:</h3>

<p>DEPRECIATED: DO NOT USE. The number of threads to allow. By default this utility will only allow one thread to be used.</p>

<p>(Int)</p>

<h3>--dropChrom dropChromosomes:</h3>

<p>A comma-delimited list of chromosomes to ignore and exclude from all analyses. Important: no whitespace!</p>

<p>(CommaDelimitedListOfStrings)</p>

<h3>--skipFunctions func1,func2,...:</h3>

<p>A comma-delimited list of functions to skip. Important: No whitespace! The default-on functions are: NVC, GCDistribution, GeneCalcs, QualityScoreDistribution, writeKnownSplices, writeNovelSplices, writeClippedNVC, CigarOpDistribution, InsertSize, chromCounts, writeSpliceExon, writeGenewiseGeneBody, JunctionCalcs, writeGeneCounts, writeDESeq, writeDEXSeq, StrandCheck</p>

<p>(CommaDelimitedListOfStrings)</p>

<h3>--addFunctions func1,func2,...:</h3>

<p>A list of functions to add. This can be used to add functions that are off by default. Followed by a comma delimited list, with no internal whitespace. The default-off functions are: FPKM, cigarMatch, makeJunctionBed, makeWiggles, makeAllBrowserTracks</p>

<p>(CommaDelimitedListOfStrings)</p>

<h3>--runFunctions func1,func2,...:</h3>

<p>The complete list of functions to run. Setting this option turns off ALL functions EXCEPT for the ones explicitly requested here. Some functions require other functions. If these functions are requested, all functions it is dependent on will also run. Followed by a comma delimited list, with no internal whitespace. Allowed options are: NVC, GCDistribution, GeneCalcs, FPKM, cigarMatch, QualityScoreDistribution, writeKnownSplices, writeNovelSplices, writeClippedNVC, CigarOpDistribution, InsertSize, chromCounts, writeSpliceExon, writeGenewiseGeneBody, JunctionCalcs, writeGeneCounts, makeJunctionBed, writeDESeq, writeDEXSeq, makeWiggles, StrandCheck, makeAllBrowserTracks</p>

<p>(CommaDelimitedListOfStrings)</p>

<h3>--seqReadCt val:</h3>

<p>(Optional) The number of reads for the replicate, prior to alignment.This will be passed on into the QC.summary.txt file.</p>

<p>(Int)</p>

<h3>--rawfastq myfastq.fq.gz:</h3>

<p>(Optional) The raw fastq, prior to alignment. This is used ONLY to calculate the number of pre-alignment reads(or read-pairs) simply by counting the number of lines and dividing by 4. The number of pre-alignment read-pairs can be included explicitly via the --seqReadCt option, or added in the plotting / cross-comparison step by including the input.read.pair.count column in the replicate decoder.In general, the --seqReadCt option is recommended when possible.
If the filename ends with ".gz" or ".zip", the file will be parsed using the appropriate decompression method.</p>

<p>(String)</p>

<h3>--chromSizes chrom.sizes.txt:</h3>

<p>A chrom.sizes file. The first (tab-delimited) column must contain all chromosomes found in the dataset. The second column must contain chromosome sizes (in base-pairs). If a standard genome is being used, it is strongly recommended that this be generated by the UCSC utility 'fetchChromSizes'.
This file is ONLY needed to produce wiggle files. If this is provided, then by default QoRTs will produce 100-bp-window wiggle files (and junction '.bed' files) for the supplied data.In order to produce wiggle files, this parameter is REQUIRED.</p>

<p>(String)</p>

<h3>--trackTitlePrefix titlePrefix:</h3>

<p>The prefix used for the track name in the track definition line of any browser tracks ('.wig' or '.bed' files) generated by this utility.Note that no browser tracks will be created by default, unless the '--chromSizes' option is set. Bed files can also be generated using the option '--addFunction makeJunctionBed'</p>

<p>(String)</p>

<h3>--verbose:</h3>

<p>Flag to indicate that debugging information and extra progress information should be sent to stderr.</p>

<p>(flag)</p>

<h3>--quiet:</h3>

<p>Flag to indicate that only errors and warnings should be sent to stderr.</p>

<p>(flag)</p>
