<h1>QoRTs: Quality of RNA-seq Tool-Set</h1>

<p>v0.3.17
Revised Thu Aug 27 13:53:48 EDT 2015</p>

<p>The QoRTs software package is a fast, efficient, and portable multifunction toolkit designed to assist in
the analysis, quality control, and data management of RNA-Seq datasets. Its primary function is to aid
in the detection and identification of errors, biases, and artifacts produced by paired-end high-throughput
RNA-Seq technology. In addition, it can produce count data designed for use with differential expression
and differential exon usage tools, as well as individual-sample and/or group-summary genome track
files suitable for use with the UCSC genome browser (or any compatible browser).</p>

<p>The entire QoRTs toolkit can be used in almost any operating system that supports java and R.</p>

<p>The most recent release of QoRTs is available on the <a href="http://github.com/hartleys/QoRTs">QoRTs github page</a>. Additional help and documentation is available online <a href="http://hartleys.github.io/QoRTs/index.html">here</a>. The creator and maintainer of QoRTs can be reached by emailing "QoRTs.contact" (at) gmail.</p>

<h2>Citing QoRTs:</h2>

<p>If you use QoRTs and find it helpful, you can cite it in your publications as:</p>

<p>Hartley SW, Mullikin JC. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4506620/"><strong>QoRTs: a comprehensive toolset for quality control and data processing of RNA-Seq experiments.</strong></a> <em>BMC Bioinformatics.</em>](http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcbioinformatics) doi: 10.1186/s12859-015-0670-5</p>

<h2>INSTALLATION:</h2>

<p>The R package can be installed in R using the command:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; install.packages("http://hartleys.github.io/QoRTs/QoRTs_LATEST.tar.gz",repos=NULL, type="source");
</code></pre>

<p>The java jar file does not need to be installed, it can simply be downloaded and used directly.
Just execute it using the java command:</p>

<pre><code>java -jar /path/to/jarfile/QoRTs.jar QC input.bam anno.gtf.gz /output/dir/
</code></pre>

<h2>EXAMPLE DATA:</h2>

<p>The example QC output can be found on the github main page, and installed
with the command:</p>

<pre><code>install.packages("http://hartleys.github.io/QoRTs/QoRTsExampleData_LATEST.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type="source")
</code></pre>

<p>The original bam files are too large to upload to github. 
These files, along with a comprehensive walkthrough demonstrating 
how all analysis can be run on them, can be found <a href="
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103621176/qorts/exData/QoRTsFullExampleData.zip">here</a>. 
(File is ~1.5gb)</p>

<h2>COMMAND-LINE HELP:</h2>

<p>Additional options and syntax information for the main QC java utility 
can be found using the command:</p>

<pre><code>java -jar /path/to/jarfile/QoRTs.jar QC --man
</code></pre>

<p>Options and information about other sub-utilities within the java package
can be found using the command:</p>

<pre><code>java -jar /path/to/jarfile/QoRTs.jar --man
</code></pre>

<p>And for each sub-utility:</p>

<pre><code>java -jar /path/to/jarfile/QoRTs.jar utilname --man
</code></pre>

<p>For help with individual R functions in the R utility, use the R command:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; help(functionname);
</code></pre>

<p>For a full listing of all help topics for the R utility, use the R command: </p>

<pre><code>&gt; help(package="QoRTs");
</code></pre>
