## v1.0.20:
* Edited LICENSE file of the R package to omit picard license info (since picard is not contained in the R package itself).
* Minor bug fixes: Fixed individual merge function. Fixed certain whitespace delimiters.

## v1.0.7:

#### Major additions to the QoRTs java utility:
* Added java function makeOrphanJunctionTrack, which makes a splice 
junction track out of the "orphan" track produced by the mergeNovelSplices utility
* Added java function makeAltJunctionTrack, which makes splice junction 
tracks out of the known and novel splice junction files produced by QoRTs QC. 
These plots are similar to the plots produced by makeOrphanJunctionTrack and
makeJunctionTrack but is produced without sharing information between 
multiple samples and thus will produce slightly different sets of splice
junctions.
* Added java function longReadClassifier. This is basically an entirely separate analysis
tool designed to characterize PacBio SMRT long read data.
* Minor bugfix: QoRTs mergeAllCounts now passes on the title line 
on the knownSplices.counts.txt file. It used to just drop the header.

#### Additions/changes to the QoRTs companion R package:
* Changed "require" calls to "requireNamespace" when calling optional 
external packages (Cairo, png, DESeq2, and edgeR). All calls to functions
belonging to these packages are now referenced using the namespace.
* Added usage examples to the manual for all individual plots. The R online
help page now includes example images for each plot, directly produced using the
example code.
* Minor changes to the vignette. Added installation instructions. Cleaned up a few
typos.
